                    The Rizal Bill was as controversial as Jose Rizal himself. The Rizal Bill involves mandating the educational institutions in the country to offer a course on the Life, Works, and writings of Jose Rizal especially his two novels; Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bill was passed into a law on June 12, 1956, it was signed by President Ramon Magsaysay, Sr.The transition of be from being a bill to becoming a republic act was, however. not easy as the proposal was met with intense opposition, particularly from the Catholic Church.

                    Claro M. Recto: <br> Dubbed as communist and anti-Catholic by critics for proposing the Rizal Bill. 
                </p><br>
                <p >
                    The main proponent of this bill is Former Senator Claro M. Recto. However, due to the bill was heavily opposed by the Catholic church, 
                    Recto was named as a communist and an Anti-Catholic. Catholic schools threatened to stop operation if the bill was passed, 
                    though Recto calmly countered the threat, stating that if that happened, the schools would be nationalized. 
                    Afterward threatened to be punished in future elections, Recto remained undeterred. Concerning the suggestion to use instead the 
                    expurgated (edited) version of Rizal's novels as mandatory readings, Recto explained his firm support for the unexpurgated version, exclaiming: "The people who would eliminate the books of Rizal from the schools would blot out from our minds the memory of the national hero. This is not a fight against Recto but a fight against Rizal". The bill was eventually passed, but with a clause
                    that would allow exemptions to students who think that reading the Noli and Fili would ruin their faith. 
                    In other words, one can apply to the Department of Education for exemption from reading Rizal's novels--though not 
                    from taking the Rizal subject. The bill was enacted on June 12, 1956.

                    For instance, it is rarely known that: (a) Rizal was involved in a love triangle with Antonio Luna as also part of the romantic equation. 
                    (b) Rizal was a model in some of Juan Luna's paintings. (c) Rizal's common-law wife, Josephine Bracken, was "remarried" to a man from Cebu and had tutored former President Sergio Osmeña.
