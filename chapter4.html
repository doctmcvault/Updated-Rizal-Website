                    In June 1872, Jose Rizal was sent by his father, Don Francisco, to Manila for further education. Initially staying in a boarding house in Intramuros, he later moved to Calle Carballo in the Santa Cruz area. Afterward, he transferred to No. 6 Calle Magallanes. Two years later, he became a boarding student at Ateneo and remained there until graduation. From 1877 to 1882, Rizal studied at the University of Santo Tomas, initially pursuing Philosophy and Letters but later shifting to Medicine. During his first year at UST, he also took a vocational course at Ateneo to become an expert surveyor. He boarded at Concha Leyva's house in Intramuros and later at Casa Tomasina, where he developed a romantic relationship with Leonor, the daughter of his landlord and uncle, Antonio Rivera. Ateneo Municipal, run by the Jesuit congregation, emphasized religious instruction, advanced education, discipline, physical culture, and the arts. Rizal's classes at Ateneo were divided into two groups, the Roman Empire (boarders) and the Carthaginian Empire (non-boarders), who engaged in healthy competition for top ranks. Rizal quickly rose through the ranks, earning the position of Emperor within a month.In June 1872, Jose Rizal was sent by his father, Don Francisco, to Manila for further education.

                <p>Throughout his education, Rizal excelled in his studies, winning prizes and medals. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree on March 23, 1877, as one of the nine outstanding students in his class. At Ateneo, Rizal cultivated his talents in poetry, engaged in gymnastics, and devoted time to painting and sculpture. He received guidance from professors such as Francisco de Paula Sanchez, whom he considered his best professor, as well as Jose Bech, Jose Vilaclara, Don Augustin Saez, and Romualdo de Jesus.</p>

                <p>In 1877, Rizal enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), initially studying Philosophy and Letters. He also took a vocational course at Ateneo, training to become a land surveyor and assessor. Rizal completed his surveyor's training in 1877 and passed the licensing examination in May 1878. After a year at UST, Rizal switched to Medicine to help his mother with her failing eyesight. However, due to discrimination from Dominican professors against Filipino students and the outdated teaching methods, he stopped attending classes in 1882. Rizal excelled in his studies at UST, receiving excellent grades in all his subjects in the Philosophy course.</p>

                 <p>In May 1882, Rizal traveled to Spain and enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid, studying Medicine and Philosophy and Letters. He participated in student demonstrations in November 1884, protesting against the excommunication of Dr. Miguel Morayta for his liberal speech. Rizal received his Licentiate in Medicine in June 1884 and the Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters on his 24th birthday.To further his medical knowledge, Rizal went to Paris and attended medical lectures at the University of Paris. He worked as an assistant to Dr. Louis de Weckert and learned various ophthalmological operations. Rizal then traveled to Heidelberg, Germany, where he attended lectures and worked at the University Eye Hospital. Under the guidance of Dr. Otto Becker, he specialized in ophthalmology and learned to use the newly invented ophthalmoscope. After completing his eye specialization, Rizal spent time in Wilhelmsfeld, writing the final chapters of Noli Me Tangere. He stayed with the Ullmer family, who became his good friends. He also attended lectures at the University of Leipzig and later reached Berlin, where he worked as an assistant in Dr. Schweigger's clinic and attended lectures at the University of Berlin.</p>

                 <p>During his time in Germany, Rizal met and befriended renowned academicians and scholars, including Prof. Friedrich Ratzel, Dr. Hanz Meyer, Dr. Feodor Jagor, Dr. Rudolf Virchow, and Dr. Hans Virchow. These connections would later become a source of pride for them, having known the educated and great Filipino, Jose Rizal.</p>

                 <p>After leaving UST in 1882 due to discrimination from Dominican professors, Rizal embarked on a "secret departure" to Spain. He traveled through various cities, including Singapore, Colombo, Naples, and Barcelona, before arriving in Madrid. In Madrid, he befriended Consuelo Ortiga y Rey and enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid, studying Medicine and Philosophy and Letters.</p>

                 <p>In 1885, Rizal moved to Paris, where he worked as an assistant to Dr. Louis de Weckert, a renowned ophthalmologist. He then traveled to Heidelberg, Germany, attending lectures and specializing in ophthalmology. During this time, he stayed in the village of Wilhelmsfeld with Protestant pastor Dr. Karl Ullmer. Rizal's correspondence with Ferdinand Blumentritt began during his time in Wilhelmsfeld. He also visited Leipzig and Dresden, where he met Dr. Adolph B. Meyer, the Director of the Anthropological and Ethnological Museum. In November 1886, Rizal went to Berlin, furthering his knowledge in ophthalmology and becoming a member of scientific communities.</p>

                  Noli Me Tangere</p><br>

                 <p>A fter completing his first novel, Noli Me Tangere, Rizal embarked on a grand tour of Europe with his friend Maximo Viola. They visited various places, including Potsdam, before returning to the Philippines. On May 11, 1887, Rizal and Viola left Berlin and visited Dresden, where they witnessed a regional floral exposition. They then traveled to Leitmeritz, Bohemia, to meet Ferdinand Blumentritt, who warmly received them and acted as their tour guide. They visited Prague, where they saw the tomb of astronomer Copernicus, and stopped at Brunn on their way to Vienna. In Vienna, they met the Austrian novelist Norfenfals and Rizal was interviewed by a correspondent of the newspaper Extra Blatt.</p>

                 <p>Leaving Vienna, they traveled by boat along the Danube River, stopping at Lintz and Salzburg. In Nuremberg, they saw the infamous torture machines used during the Catholic Inquisition, and in Ulm, they climbed Germany's tallest cathedral. They also visited Stuttgart, Baden, and Rheinfall, where they saw Europe's most beautiful waterfall.</p>

                <p>In Switzerland, they toured Schaffhausen, Basel, Bern, and Lausanne before staying in Geneva. Rizal's stay in Geneva was enjoyable, except for learning about the exhibition of Igorots in Madrid, where they were ridiculed and one woman died of pneumonia.</p>

                <p>On June 19, 1887, Rizal treated Viola for his birthday, and four days later, they parted ways, with Viola returning to Barcelona and Rizal proceeding to Italy. In Italy, Rizal visited Turin, Milan, Venice, and Florence. In Rome, he visited historical places such as the Amphitheatre and the Roman Forum, and on June 29, he saw the famous St. Peter's Church in the Vatican City.</p>

                <p>Despite warnings, Rizal decided to return to his native land. He boarded the steamer "Djemnah" in Marseilles on July 3, 1887, and sailed through the Suez Canal, reaching Saigon on July 30. He then took the steamer "Haiphong" and arrived in Manila on August 5. After meeting friends in Manila, he returned to Calamba on August 8.</p>

                <p>Rizal's enemies alleged that his book, "Noli Me Tangere," contained subversive ideas, leading to his summons by Governor-General Emilio Terrero. Although Terrero saw no problem with the book, he assigned a bodyguard, Don Jose Taviel de Andrade, to protect Rizal from his adversaries.</p>

                <p>In December 1887, the Calamba community sought Rizal's assistance in collecting information about Dominican hacienda management. Rizal objectively reported that the Dominican Order had increased land rent arbitrarily and charged tenants for nonexistent agricultural services. Enraged by Rizal's reports, the friars pressured the governor-general to advise Rizal to leave the country.</p>

                <p>Despite the challenges, Rizal's second journey abroad provided him with new adventurous experiences.</p>
