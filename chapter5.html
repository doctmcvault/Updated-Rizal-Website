            	<h2 style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: -40px;">Bitter-Sweet Life in Dapitan</h2>

                <p >
                    Jose Rizal refused to retract his anti-Catholic statements and make a confession, leading him to choose residency at the commandant's residence in Dapitan over the parish convent. He formed a close friendship with Captain Ricardo Carnicero, the commandant, blurring the lines between their official roles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, Rizal and Carnicero won a lottery and used their winnings to purchase land near Dapitan. On this land, Rizal built houses, including a square-shaped residence for himself, a hexagonal barn for chickens, and established a school, teaching practical subjects and providing care for recovering patients from out of town.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Daily Life as an Exile</h2>
                <p >
                    During his exile in Dapitan, Jose Rizal led a multifaceted life, practicing medicine, teaching pupils, and engaging in farming and horticulture. His daily routine involved tending to plants and animals, treating patients, teaching students, and dedicating evenings to reading and writing, showcasing a balanced and fulfilling existence.
                </p><br>
               
               	<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Rizal and the Jesuits</h2>
                <p >
                    The Jesuit Order made persistent efforts to convince Jose Rizal to return to the Catholic faith. Initially, they proposed that he could live in the Dapitan convent under specific conditions, but Rizal declined, unwilling to compromise his principles. The Jesuits then assigned Father Francisco de Paula Sanchez, Rizal's former teacher at Ateneo, to engage in religious discussions with him. Despite their friendly conversations, Rizal remained unwavering in his beliefs, although he maintained a positive relationship with Father Sanchez. Furthermore, Father Pablo Pastells, the superior of the Jesuit Society in the Philippines, corresponded with Rizal from September 1892 to April 1893, attempting to persuade him to embrace Catholicism. Despite regularly attending mass in Dapitan, Rizal steadfastly refused to adopt conventional Catholic beliefs, as demonstrated in his scholarly exchanges with Father Pastells.

                <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Achievements in Dapitan</h2>
                <p >
                    During his time in Dapitan, Rizal contributed significantly to the community through various achievements and services:
                </p><br>
               	<p style="text-indent: 0;">    
					1. Infrastructure and Sanitation: Rizal improved the town's drainage system and water supply by ingeniously using empty bottles and bamboo joints. He also educated the townspeople about health and sanitation practices to prevent the spread of diseases.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;" >
					2. Educational and Artistic Endeavors: Alongside his Jesuit friend Sanchez, Rizal created a large relief map of Mindanao in Dapitan plaza, contributing to both education and public appreciation of geography. He also enhanced the local forest by establishing trails, stairs, and benches for community enjoyment.
				</p><br>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">
					3. Innovations in Construction: Rizal invented a wooden machine for the mass production of bricks, which he used to build a dam for the community with the assistance of his students.                                          
				</p><br>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">
					4. Medical Services: Serving as the town's doctor, Rizal treated patients regardless of their economic or social status. He accepted various forms of payment, including poultry and crops, and sometimes provided free services to the poor. His specialization was in ophthalmology, but he treated a wide range of ailments, including fever, sprains, broken bones, typhoid, tuberculosis, and leprosy.
				</p><br>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">
					5. Livelihood Support: Rizal aided abaca farmers by trading their crops in Manila and teaching them abaca-weaving techniques to produce hammocks. He also improved local fishing methods by teaching more efficient techniques and helping to introduce better fishing nets.

					Rizal's multifaceted contributions to Dapitan reflect his dedication to public service, education, innovation, and community welfare, making a lasting impact on the town and its residents.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;"">As a Scientist and Philologist</h2>
                <p >
                    As a scientist and philologist, Rizal made significant contributions during his time in Dapitan:
               	<p style="text-indent: 0;">    
					1. Exploration of Flora and Fauna: Rizal conducted thorough inspections of Dapitan's diverse flora and fauna, providing taxonomic classifications for numerous forest and sea creatures. He established a laboratory and herbarium from which he sent various biological specimens to scientists in Europe, including his friend Doctor Adolph B. Meyer in Dresden. In return, European scholars sent him books and other academic materials.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">
					2. Taxonomic Naming: Rizal's collections led to the naming of at least three species after him: a Dapitan frog (Rhacophorus rizali), a type of beetle (Apogonia rizal), and a flying dragon (Draco rizali).
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;">
					3. Study of Languages and Culture: Rizal expanded his linguistic skills by learning the Visayan language and delving into the study of language, culture, and literature. He examined local folklore, customs, Tagalog grammar, and the Malay language. Rizal shared his intellectual findings on these subjects with European academicians, including Doctor Reinhold Rost, his close philologist friend in London.                                          
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0;"><br>
					Rizal's endeavors as a scientist and philologist demonstrate his intellectual curiosity and dedication to expanding knowledge across various fields, bridging cultures and fostering scholarly exchange between Europe and the Philippines.
				</p><br>

				<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">The Spies and Secret Emissary</h2>
                <p >
                    During his time in Dapitan, Rizal faced various encounters with spies and secret emissaries:
               	<p style="text-indent: 0px;">    
					<b>1. Matias Arrieta:</b> A physician named Matias Arrieta, sent as a spy, confessed his mission to Rizal and sought forgiveness after being cured by him.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>2. Pablo Mercado (Florencio Nanaman):</b> In March 1895, a man claiming to be Rizal's relative, Pablo Mercado, offered to deliver Rizal's letters to certain individuals in Manila. However, Rizal discovered that Mercado's real name was Florencio Nanaman, a secret agent paid by the Recollect friars. Despite Nanaman's deceit, Rizal showed kindness by allowing him to spend the night in his home during a rainy evening.
				</p style="text-indent: 0px;">
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>2. Dr. Pio Valenzuela:</b>3 In June the following year, Dr. Pio Valenzuela arrived in Dapitan as an emissary from Andres Bonifacio, the Katipunan leader. Valenzuela, disguised as a companion of a blind patient seeking treatment, delivered the Katipunan's message to Rizal. However, Rizal declined to support the uprising, advocating for peaceful means over violent revolution. He believed that a successful revolution required arms and financial backing from wealthy Filipinos, recommending individuals like Antonio Luna, knowledgeable in military strategy, for support.                                        
				</p><br>

                <p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; text-indent: 0; margin-top: 8px;">
                    Doctor Pio Valenzuela:  <br> He was sent by Bonifacio to Rizal in Dapitan; Valenzuela City was named after him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These encounters highlight Rizal's complex interactions with individuals seeking his support or attempting to gather incriminating evidence against him. Despite the challenges, Rizal remained steadfast in his principles and convictions, advocating for peaceful means of achieving freedom and demonstrating compassion even towards those who deceived him.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Visited by loved ones</h2><br>
                <p>
                    During his exile in Dapitan, Rizal experienced the loss of his beloved Leonor Rivera, which deeply saddened him. However, his desolation was somewhat alleviated by visits from his family members:
               	<br>
                <p style="text-indent: 0px;">    
					<b>1. Mother and Sisters: </b>In August 1893, Rizal's mother, Doña Teodora, accompanied by his sister Trinidad, joined him in Dapitan. They resided together in his square house, and Rizal successfully operated on his mother's cataract. At different times, his sisters Maria and Narcisa also visited him.
				</p><br>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>2. Nephews and Niece: Rizal's </b>nephews Mauricio (Moris), Teodosio (Osio), and Estanislao (Tan), as well as his niece Angelica, also spent time in Dapitan and received their early education under his guidance.
				</p><br>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>3. Josephine Bracken: </b>After Doña Teodora left for Manila in 1895 to be with Rizal's father, who was ill, Josephine Bracken entered Rizal's life. Josephine, an orphan with Irish heritage and the stepdaughter of one of Rizal's patients from Hong Kong, became his companion and common-law wife. However, they couldn't have a church wedding due to Rizal's refusal to retract his anti-Catholic views. Despite this, Josephine remained by his side and managed their household.

                <p>
                	Tragically, their union was marked by sorrow when their son, Francisco, named after Rizal's father, was born prematurely and died shortly after birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Rizal's experiences during his exile in Dapitan were marked by both personal loss and the presence of loved ones, who provided him with companionship and support during challenging times.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Goodbye Dapitan</h2>
                <p >
                    In 1895, Rizal learned from Blumentritt about the yellow-fever epidemic in Cuba, another Spanish colony engulfed in revolution. Feeling compelled to help, Rizal wrote to Governor-General Ramon Blanco in December 1895, offering his medical services. However, receiving no response from Blanco, Rizal's interest waned.
               	<p >    
					Unexpectedly, on July 30, 1896, Rizal received a letter from the governor-general approving his request to serve as a volunteer physician in Cuba. Quickly making preparations, Rizal sold and gave away his possessions as souvenirs to friends and students.
				</p>
				<p >
					On the late afternoon of July 31, Rizal boarded the "España" with Josephine, Narcisa, a niece, three nephews, and three students. The departure stirred emotions among the people of Dapitan, especially Rizal's students, who bid him farewell with heartfelt cries of "Adios, Dr. Rizal." Moved by their affection, Rizal waved goodbye, saying, "Adios, Dapitan."
				</p>
				<p >
					The steamer set sail for Manila at midnight on July 31, 1896. Reflecting on his departure, Rizal wrote in his diary aboard the ship, "I have been in that district four years, thirteen days, and a few hours." This poignant moment marked the end of Rizal's exile in Dapitan, where he had made significant contributions and forged deep connections with the community.

				<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;"  >From Dapitan to Trial in Fort Santiago</h2>
                <p >
                  	During Rizal's journey from Dapitan to Manila, significant events transpired as the steamer España made several stopovers:

					Unexpectedly, on July 30, 1896, Rizal received a letter from the governor-general approving his request to serve as a volunteer physician in Cuba. Quickly making preparations, Rizal sold and gave away his possessions as souvenirs to friends and students.

				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>1. Dumaguete:</b> Rizal visited friends, including a former classmate from Madrid, and provided medical treatment to a sick civil captain.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>2. Cebu: </b>In Cebu, Rizal performed four surgeries and prescribed medications for numerous other patients.                                   
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>3. Iloilo: </b>While in Iloilo, Rizal explored the historical Mactan Island and admired the architecture of the Molo Church. He also went shopping during his time there.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
					<b>4. Capiz and Romblon: </b>The ship made additional stops in Capiz and Romblon before finally arriving in Manila.
				</p>
				<p>These stopovers not only provided Rizal with opportunities to reconnect with friends and explore significant landmarks but also allowed him to continue practicing medicine and providing care to those in need. Little did he know that his return to Manila would mark the beginning of a tumultuous period leading to his trial and eventual execution at Fort Santiago.
				</p><br>

				<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">In Manila</h2>
                <p>
                  	Upon nearing Luzon, an attempt by Katipuneros to aid Rizal's escape occurred. Emilio Jacinto, disguised as a crew member, approached Rizal, while Guillermo Masankay circled the ship in a boat. However, Rizal remained steadfast in his commitment to his mission in Cuba, declining the rescue attempt.
               	</p>    
               	<p>
                  	Rizal arrived in Manila on August 6, 1896, a day after the mail boat Isla de Luzon had departed for Spain. Forced to wait for the next steamer, Rizal, fearing trouble during his stay, requested isolation except for his family. In response, he was transferred to the cruiser Castilla docked at Cavite.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	On August 19, the Katipunan plot to revolt was uncovered, leading to the arrest of many members. In response, the Katipunan decided to initiate the armed revolt immediately, tearing their residence certificates as a symbol of commitment.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	The revolt commenced on August 29 and 30, with Katipuneros attacking the Civil Guard garrison in Pasig and the Spanish soldiers protecting the powder magazine in San Juan. Spanish reinforcements resulted in the death of around 150 Katipuneros and the capture of over 200. Subsequently, a state of war was declared in Manila and nearby provinces.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	On August 30, Governor-General Blanco issued letters to the Spanish Minister of War and Minister of Colonies, clearing Rizal of any involvement in the uprising. On September 2, Rizal was transferred to the ship Isla de Panay, marking another significant shift in his journey and the unfolding events leading to his eventual trial.

               	<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Going to Spain</h2>
                <p >
                  	After departing Manila, the steamer Isla de Panay sailed towards Barcelona. In Singapore, Rizal was encouraged by some Filipinos, including Don Pedro Roxas and Don Manuel Camus, to remain in the British-controlled territory. However, Rizal trusted Governor-General Blanco's assurances and declined to stay.
               	</p>    
               	<p>
                  	Unbeknownst to Rizal, plans for his arrest were already underway, as Blanco and the Ministers of War and Colonies had been exchanging telegrams. As the Isla de Panay stopped in Port Said, Egypt on September 27, Rizal learned of the worsening situation in the Philippines, with thousands of Spanish soldiers dispatched and Filipinos either killed or arrested in the uprising. Feeling increasingly isolated by his fellow passengers, Rizal sent a letter to Blumentritt, informing him of the imminent threat of arrest.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	Upon reaching Malta on September 30, Rizal was officially ordered to remain in his cabin until further instructions from Blanco. The Isla de Panay finally reached Barcelona on October 3, 1896, where Rizal was placed under heavy guard by General Eulogio Despujol, the former governor-general who had deported him to Dapitan in 1892.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	On the morning of October 6, Rizal was transported to the Monjuich prison-fortress. Later that afternoon, Despujol informed him of the order to return to Manila. Rizal was then taken aboard the ship "Colon," which departed for Manila at 8 p.m. The ship was filled with Spanish soldiers and their families, who were instructed not to approach or communicate with Rizal. Despite being allowed to take walks on deck during the journey, Rizal was handcuffed and confined before reaching any port, signaling the beginning of another chapter in his tumultuous journey.

               	<h2 class="text-center" style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">Last Homecoming</h2>
                <p >
                  	Upon his arrival in Manila on November 3, 1896, Rizal was detained in Fort Santiago, where he had been imprisoned four years earlier. In an effort to gather evidence against him, Rizal's friends, acquaintances, La Liga members, and even his brother Paciano were subjected to torture and interrogation. Colonel Francisco Olive, the same military leader who had forced Rizal's family to leave their Calamba home in 1890, conducted preliminary investigations by interrogating Rizal and others. Witnesses coerced into testifying against Rizal were not allowed to be cross-examined.
               	</p>    
               	<p>
                  	Rizal admitted to knowing most of those questioned but denied any association with Andres Bonifacio or Apolinario Mabini until the end. Fifteen pieces of documentary evidence, including Rizal's letters, letters from his compatriots, a poem, a Masonic document, and transcripts of speeches by Katipuneros, were presented. Testimonial evidence included oral testimonies from 13 Filipinos, notably La Liga officers and a Katipunero.

               	<p>
                  	On November 26, Olive submitted reports to Governor-General Blanco, who assigned Captain Rafael Dominguez as special Judge Advocate in Rizal's case. After examining the case, Judge Advocate-General Don Nicolas dela Peña recommended that Rizal be brought to trial immediately, kept in jail, have his property attached, and be defended by a Spanish army officer.
               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	On December 6, Rizal was given the limited right to choose his lawyer from a list of 100 Spanish army officers. He chose Lt. Luis Taviel de Andrade, the younger brother of his former bodyguard-friend. Three days later, on December 11, formal charges were read to Rizal in his prison cell, with Andrade by his side. He was accused of organizing the revolution and spreading rebellious ideas, but he pleaded not guilty, explaining that La Liga was just a civic organization.

               	<p>
               		On December 13, the day Carmilo G. de Polavieja replaced Blanco as governor-general, Rizal's case papers were sent to Malacañang. On December 15, Rizal wrote a manifesto urging revolutionaries to pursue liberty through education and labor, but De la Peña interpreted it as advocating rebellion. Consequently, Polavieja refused to issue Rizal's manifesto.

                <p >
                    On the morning of December 26, Rizal, once symbolically referred to by Spanish authorities as a "trapped rat," appeared in a kangaroo court within the military building, Cuartel de España. He faced trial before seven military court members, with Lt. Col. Jose Togores Arjona presiding.
               	<p >    
					Judge Advocate Dominguez presented Rizal's criminal case, followed by a passionate speech from Prosecuting Attorney Enrique de Alcocer. Alcocer emotionally appealed to the Spanish judges, invoking the memory of Spanish soldiers who died in the revolt and characterizing Rizal as an "Oriental" seeking power beyond his social status. Alcocer demanded Rizal's death sentence and a significant fine.
				</p>
				<p >
					Rizal's defense counsel, Lt. Andrade, vigorously defended his client, emphasizing the natural desire for liberty and independence. Rizal himself presented his defense, arguing logically against his involvement in the revolution and distinguishing La Liga from Katipunan. He cited instances where he advised against revolt and claimed ignorance of the revolution's use of his name.

                	Following the trial, Col. Arjona promptly declared it over. Despite the efforts of the defense, Rizal was quickly deemed guilty, and the jury unanimously voted for the death sentence. The trial concluded with the reading of the sentence: death by firing squad. Governor-General Polavieja signed the court decision on December 28, ordering the execution for 7 a.m. on December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (Luneta). Rizal, required to sign the verdict, stoically signed his own death sentence.

                <p >
                  	The events of Jose Rizal's last 25 hours, beginning from 6 a.m. on December 29, 1896, until his execution, remain controversial and subject to varying historical accounts. This period is particularly contentious due to conflicting claims, including suggestions of Rizal's supposed retraction of his beliefs and a Catholic marriage with Josephine Bracken.
               	</p>    
               	<p>
                  	These claims have sparked debates among historians, with some supporting the assertion that Rizal indeed retracted his beliefs and embraced Catholicism before his execution. Others contest this narrative, arguing that there is insufficient evidence to support such claims and that Rizal remained steadfast in his principles until the end.

               	</p> 
               	<p>
                  	The controversy surrounding Rizal's last hours underscores the complexities of historical interpretation and the challenges inherent in reconstructing events from the past. Despite the differing accounts, Rizal's legacy as a national hero of the Philippines endures, leaving an indelible mark on the country's history and collective memory.

He received a visit from Jesuit priests Miguel Saderra Mata and Luis Viza, who brought him the medal of the Ateneo's Marian Congregation and a wooden statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which Rizal had carved during his time at the school. Rizal accepted the wooden statue but rejected the medal, stating, "I'm little of a Marian, Father."

                <p>
                	•	As the visitors left, Rizal gave his mother an alcohol cooking stove as a gift from the Pardo de Taveras, whispering something to her that the guards couldn't comprehend. This "something" was Rizal's elegy, now known as "Mi Ultimo Adios."

                	The events leading to Jose Rizal's execution on December 30, 1896, are vividly recounted in historical records. Here's a summary of the final moments of his life:
                </p>
                <div class="a">
                <p>
                	•	At 6:30 a.m., Rizal, dressed in a black suit and black bowler hat, commenced his slow walk to Bagumbayan (now Luneta). He walked alongside his defense lawyer, Lt. Luis Taviel de Andrade, and two Jesuit priests, Fathers Estanislao March and José Vilaclara. Guards of armed soldiers led the procession, with another group of military men behind them.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	The streets were lined with eager spectators, some sympathetic to Rizal's plight while others, particularly the Spaniards, wished for his demise. There was anticipation that his family or supporters might attempt a last-minute rescue.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	Rizal engaged in occasional conversation with the priests, reminiscing about his days at the Ateneo and commenting on the morning's beauty.

                	•	Upon reaching the execution site, Filipino soldiers comprised the firing squad, with Spanish soldiers behind them in readiness to execute them should they refuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	There was a slight disruption as Rizal refused to kneel and declined the blindfold, asserting his innocence and patriotism. After negotiation, he agreed to turn his back to the firing squad but insisted on being shot in the back instead of the head.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	Rizal shook hands with his defense lawyer and allowed the military physician to check his pulse, which was surprisingly normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	The priests offered Rizal a crucifix to kiss, but he turned his head away in silence, preparing for his imminent death.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	At the command, the executioners fired their guns simultaneously. Rizal uttered Christ's last words, "Consummatum est" (It is finished), and made a final effort to twist his body halfway around before falling to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                	•	Jose Rizal was pronounced dead at precisely 7:03 a.m. on December 30, 1896, marking the tragic end of his life but igniting the flames of inspiration and patriotism among Filipinos for generations to come.
