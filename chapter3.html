                    Dona Teodora Alonso (aka Lolay)</p><br>
                <p>Jose's mother, Dona Teodora Alonso, also known as “Lolay”, was born on November 8, 1826. She was a business-savvy, graceful, and courageous woman who was also well-mannered, religious, and well-read.</p>

                <p>Her family is believed to have descended from Lakandula, the last native king of Tondo. Following the Claveria decree of 1849, the Alonsos adopted the surname Realonda.</p>
                <p>Jose Rizal's birth was a particularly painful one for Dona Teodora due to his larger than average head size. She played a significant role in his education, teaching him Spanish, coaching him in rhetoric, and correcting his composed poems. By the age of three, Jose Rizal had learned the alphabet and Catholic prayers, and by five, he could read and write.</p>

                <p>Among Jose Rizal's siblings were Saturnina, the oldest, who married Manuel T. Hidalgo of Tanawan, Batangas; Paciano, who Jose regarded as the "Most Nobles of Filipinos"; Narcisa, known as "Sisa", who married Antonio Lopez at Morong, Rizal; Olympia, known as "Ypia", who married Sylvestre Ubaldo, a telegraph operator from Manila; Lucia, the 5th child, who married Mariano Herbosa; and Maria, also known as "Biang", who married Daniel Faustino Cruz.Jose Rizal, also known as "Pepe", is recognized as the greatest Filipino Hero. He was married to Josephine Bracken. His other siblings include Concepcion, known as "Concha", who died at the age of 3; Josefa, known as "Panggoy", a member of the Katipunan and an old maid; Trinidad, known as "Trining", who lived to be 83; and Soledad, the youngest, known as "Choleng", who married Pantaleon Quintero of Calamba and worked as a teacher.</p>

                    <p>Jose Rizal, an individual of exceptional talent and admiration, fondly remembers the joyous days spent in their family garden at the age of three. Despite being frail and undersized, he received the utmost care from his parents, who even built a nipa cottage for him to play in during the day.</p>

                    <p>A cherished childhood memory was the daily Angelus prayer in their home. At the tender age of three, he began participating in these family prayers. When his sister Concha passed away due to illness in 1865, a grieving Jose wept for her loss. By the age of five, he had learned to read the Spanish family Bible. He showed a deep interest in religion, often visiting the chapel to pray, participating in novenas, and joining religious processions.</p>

                    Priest Leonico Lopez</p><br>
                
                    <p>In his hometown, he held in high regard the erudite Catholic Priest Leoncio Lopez. He frequently visited him, finding inspiration in his insightful opinions on current events and comprehensive life views. Around the same age, Rizal started to display his artistic abilities, making pencil sketches and molding objects in clay and wax.</p>

                    <p>When he was six, his sisters found amusement in his penchant for creating clay and wax figures, to which he responded prophetically, "Alright, laugh at me now! Someday when I die, people will make monuments and images of me." </p>

                    <p>At the age of seven, Jose had the experience of riding a casco with his father on a pilgrimage to Antipolo. His father gifted him a pony named "Alipato", which he adored riding, often accompanied by his black dog, "Usman", on long walks.</p>

                        Jose Alberto</p><br> 

                    <p>Before turning eight, he had written a drama that was performed at a local festival. The manuscript of the drama was bought for two pesos by a gobernadorcillo from Paete. Contrary to popular belief, Rizal did not write the Filipino poem "Sa Aking mga Kababata/Kabata".Young Rizal also displayed an interest in magic, mastering various tricks, such as making a coin disappear or a handkerchief vanish into thin air. His childhood was significantly shaped by the influence of his three uncles. </p>

                    <p>Jose Alberto played a crucial role in nurturing his artistic talents. His Uncle Manuel urged him to strengthen his weak physique through regular physical workouts. Moreover, his Uncle Gregorio fueled his passion for reading quality literature.</p>
